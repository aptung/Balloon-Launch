# Balloon-Launch
Arduino code for the balloon launch. For ASR 2021-2022.

Folder "Arduino_2" contains all the files for Arduino 2. There are a lot of these because there are a lot of individual projects, but the main file is actually Arduino_2.ino, which calls all the other ones.

Folder "Individual_files" contains the code for the individual experiments in stand-alone files. These should all work because they came from the people themselves.

File "Balloon_launch_OLD.ino" contains the code which was used for the tethered launch, before we decided to split into different Arduinos. It is believed to be bug-free (although it is pretty complicated).
